"""Concurrency helpers that don't fit anyio's task-group cancellation model.

anyio's :class:`anyio.abc.TaskGroup` cancels every sibling on the first
exception. That's the right default for most of the codebase, but the fan-out
sites in :mod:`slopmortem.ingest` and :mod:`slopmortem.stages.synthesize` need
the opposite — one failed candidate must not cancel its siblings.
:func:`gather_resilient` wraps the asyncio primitive that gives that
behaviour, so the rest of the code only has to import this helper.
