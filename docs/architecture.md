The CLI does one `anyio.run` per subcommand and that's it. Below that, every stage is `async def`. fastembed is CPU-bound, so it hops onto a thread via `anyio.to_thread.run_sync`. The synthesis fan-out goes through `gather_resilient` (an `anyio.gather` wrapper that returns exceptions instead of cancelling siblings). Each SDK keeps one connection pool alive for the whole invocation. You don't think that matters until you watch six sequential LLM calls each pay the TLS handshake tax.

## Query flow

You type `slopmortem query "we're building a marketplace for industrial scrap metal"`. Here's what runs.

1. **Facets.** Haiku reads the pitch and slaps structured fields on it: sector, business model, stage, that kind of thing. These narrow what we retrieve and feed the rerank rubric later.
2. **Embeddings.** Dense via fastembed `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (local ONNX, 768d). Sparse via fastembed BM25. Two vectors per query, both free.
3. **Retrieve.** Qdrant runs three prefetches in parallel (dense, sparse, and one filtered by your facets), then fuses them server-side with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Top 30 come back. No HyDE, no query rewriting. We skipped HyDE because Haiku has a known habit of rewriting pitches as post-mortem openings stuffed with its favorite failure tropes ("ran out of runway", "scaled too fast"), and that would bias retrieval toward generic-failure clusters. Rerank at K=30 → N=5 should absorb the modality gap. Revisit in v2 if real-pitch recall measures poorly.
4. **Rerank.** One Sonnet call scores all 30 against a multi-perspective rubric. Output is JSON via OpenRouter's `response_format=json_schema`, which routes to Anthropic's grammar-constrained sampling on the backend. No tools, no corpus reads, nothing to parse out of prose. Top 5 survive.
5. **Synthesize.** The first call runs alone, on purpose. It writes the prompt cache so the other four don't race to write the same prefix. We assert `cache_creation_tokens > 0` on that warm response, because Anthropic's cache is eventually consistent across regions and a 200 OK doesn't actually mean the prefix replicated yet. One re-warm retry if it didn't. Then the rest fan out under `anyio.CapacityLimiter(N)` with `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)`, so one flaky candidate drops one report instead of killing all five. The model can hit `get_post_mortem` or `search_corpus` mid-generation if it wants more context. The LLM emits an `LLMSynthesis`; the pipeline composes the user-visible `Synthesis` from it plus `failure_date` and `lifespan_months` derived from the candidate's typed `CandidatePayload`, so those two fields can't be fabricated from prose.
6. **Consolidate risks.** One Sonnet call reads the pitch and every per-candidate lesson, merges paraphrases, and drops anything that doesn't latch onto something concrete in the pitch. The Jaccard pass it replaced was happily emitting "don't use MLM" on pitches with no referral mechanic. Output is up to 10 risks, each with a severity bucket and an `applies_because` line that has to name a specific bit of the pitch. The stage caps highs at 4 and drops any fabricated `candidate_id` the model invents. Skipped on `BudgetExceededError`.
7. **Render.** Markdown to stdout. Top-risks section first when present, then per-candidate sections, then a footer with cost, latency, and the trace ID. Paste the Laminar link from the terminal when something looks off.

A default 5-comparable query runs around $0.10 warm / $0.30 cold cache and 90–130 seconds; the sample in [`docs/examples/crypto-savings-yield/`](examples/crypto-savings-yield/) recorded `cost=$0.14`, `latency=126.7s`. Tavily synthesis enrichment bumps both. Cap is $2.00; the budget tracker raises if you blow past it.

## Ingest flow

`slopmortem ingest` is the bulk path. Default sources are a curated YAML and HN's Algolia API; the Wayback Machine and a Crunchbase CSV are opt-in adapters. Tavily is an opt-in enricher (synthesis-time or ingest-time), not a source.

1. **Fetch.** Plain HTTP. trafilatura strips nav and cookie banners. A length floor drops the obviously empty pages.
2. **Slop classify.** Haiku scores each fetched body; anything above `slop_threshold` lands in `quarantine/` with no journal row and no embedding. `slopmortem ingest --reclassify` is the only way back.
3. **LLM fan-out.** Two calls per doc, one for facets and one for the rerank summary. All ~1000 run live under `anyio.CapacityLimiter(20)`. No Batches discount here because OpenRouter doesn't proxy that API. The shared system block sets `cache_control={"ttl":"1h"}`, and we fire one sync call right before the fan-out so workers hit a populated cache instead of racing to write it. The first five responses sample `cache_read_tokens / (cache_read + cache_creation)`. If the read ratio is under 80% we know before spending the rest of the budget. The 1-hour TTL recovers most of what Batches would have saved.
4. **Embed.** Dense and sparse both on the local CPU. fastembed downloads a 550 MB ONNX model on first use and caches it under `~/.cache/fastembed`. CI runs `slopmortem embed-prefetch` once so the first ingest doesn't pay the download tax.
5. **Entity resolution.** Three tiers. Domain match first, then embedding similarity, then a Haiku tiebreaker for the actually ambiguous pairs. The point of all this is to stop "Crunchbase obituary + founder's farewell blog post" from showing up as two separate dead startups.
6. **Merge.** Journal flips the row to `pending`, markdown lands via `os.replace`, Qdrant gets upserted, then the journal flips to `complete`. If something dies in the middle (Ctrl-C, OOM, bad network, whatever), `slopmortem ingest --reconcile` walks the three stores and patches whatever drifted.

The initial 500-URL seed costs about $7.50. The cap is $15 because retries happen, the no-Batches path has less cushion, and I wanted slack. Steady-state on the HN feed is roughly $0.10/week, small enough that I stopped tracking it.

## What's where

Underscore-prefixed submodules (`_foo.py`) are package-private; callers import
from the package's `__init__.py`. Listing them here is descriptive, not
prescriptive — the import contract is the package boundary.
