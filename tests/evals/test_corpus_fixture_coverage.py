"""Coverage check: every seed-dataset sector must have at least one matching corpus entry.

Lightweight invariant — runs in milliseconds, no Qdrant, no LLM. Exists to
flag the next time someone bumps the corpus fixture without realising the
seed dataset still expects matching sectors. If this test fails, either
expand the inputs YAML and re-record, or update the seed.
